# MNIST-Digit-classification---PyTorch
#Classifying handwritten Digits using PyTorch.
1)PyTorch is a Python-based library built by Facebook's Artificial Intelligence research group.
2)It is a based on machine learning package called Torch used in Lua programming language.

Key Features of pyTorch:
PyTorch is similar to scientific computing library, NumPy, in terms of workflow and flexibility.
Here are some of the critical features of PyTorch:
Ease of Use - Tensor operations are close to NumPy and have excellent documentation.
Python Support - One of the most extensive open source library, and PyTorch provides an implementation for almost all the computations in deep learning.
Dynamic graph computation - Unlike TensorFlow, Computational graphs can be defined and changed at runtime.

Installations:
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib
